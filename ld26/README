-- Color Bounce --
       by Shuall

This is a game with colors. And you bounce.
It is compiled with glfw3 from git https://github.com/glfw/glfw
 and an opengl 3.3 or higher graphics card.

I tried to make the menu controls intuitive, so try to play without
 reading the rest of this, but I may not have succeeded.

scoreboard has your score in blue, and the highscore for the selected
 difficulty in the corresponding color.
R = reset level
Continue = go back to game (Esc will also work)
Q = quit to main menu

left side is jump counter
right side is height (which is your score)
